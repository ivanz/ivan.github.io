Yesterday I presented my Programming 1 Coursework and got &#8230; 100% mark. The lectureres were very suprised from what I&#8217;ve done and sayed that &#8220;it is a superb project&#8221; :). I am very happy, because I didn&#8217;t follow the specifications exactly. I used Mono instead of MS .Net and developed the whole project on Linux (obviously instead of Windows) using MonoDevelop from SVN instead of Microsoft Visual Studio .Net 2003. This was possible with GTK# (the C# wrapper for Mono). The project was to develop a MasterMind game. I&#8217;ve published the sources under GPL on my svn &#8211; http://websvn.ivanz.com .  
And that&#8217;s not all &#8211; I&#8217;ve got 100% for my IT and Professional Coursework too. Now I am waiting for the 100% for the Quantitive Methods for Computing Courework.
