Yesterday I arrived successfully at home (Bulgaria). It was an alwful flight. It was supposed to take approx 3 to 4 hours with the transfer in Milan, Italy, but took approx 20 hours. First of all in London the plain had some technical problems before taking off and it took them 1 hour and a half to fix it, so I missed my transfer flight, because I had only 40 minutes between the landing in Milan and the taking off with the second flight to Bulgaria. Also during the flight London-Milan one guy was sick and lost consiness. At least the flight company was ready to cover my expenses for a hotel till the next flight, but I was lucky, because there was one on the same day. But from that point the &#8220;fun&#8221; started. My mum called me that the airport in Sofia, Bulgaria was closed, because of the bad weather. It took them 4 hours to open the airport again. The problem was that the weather was variable and noone knew if we are going to land in Sofia or in Burgas at the end. If we&#8217;ve landed in Burgas this meaned that the flight company was going to drive us with buses to Sofia. Because of the snow this could have taken 10 hours or more and I was already tired enough. Anyway at the end we landed successfully in Sofia. After our plane 4 more landed, but still our luggage came out after theirs and guess what &#8230; 10 guys including me were missing theirs. After complaining in an office we were told that our luggage will be delivered the day after at our homes. This is what happened indeed. I had a nice trip, eh. <img src="{{ site.url }}/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
