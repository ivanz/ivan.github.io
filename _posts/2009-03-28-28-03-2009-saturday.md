  * Got up late today. I got up, walked to my desk, turned off my phone&#8217;s alarm then took it back to bed with the idea to set an alarm for 30min later and fell asleep before that.
  * Disabled WordPress post revisions by adding to *wp-config.php*: *define(’WP\_POST\_REVISIONS’, false);*
  * Read a [review of GTA IV][1] which pretty much shares my opinion of the game as well. I myself think they killed GTA after they made it in 3D, because it lost all the silly fun involved in it. Pretty much the same happened to Worms. It became yet another game with supposedly amazing graphics and physics, but boring as hell. I don&#8217;t care about the graphics of games. I don&#8217;t care if my car is more like a real car. I only want to play an interesting and fun game! Surprise me, game industry.
  * Cycled on my exercise bike: 50min, 18km, 410kcal, pulse average 65% (~128bpm)
  * Did a little work on my Security Assessment coursework.
  * Watched [Traitor][2] on the side, which turned out to be really bad casted crappy movie rip off (&#8220;remake&#8221;) of the [Sleeper Cell series][3] which on the other hand are awesome. Only the ending is worth it cause it&#8217;s kind of funny since all suicide bombers end up being on the same bus instead in 50 different ones :).
  * Z surprised me with that she has managed to get on an earlier train so I am rushing out to pick her up from the train station. Probably going to spend the evening watching movies, playing games and relaxing.
