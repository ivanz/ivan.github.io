I started at IBM UK (Hursley Labs) on Monday but it is only today that I got my permanent badge with all the security clearance added for the ultra confidential work I will be doing. ðŸ˜€ One of the goodies when working in the restricted area is that only the chosen ones get access to the proper coffee machine which makes excellent espresso coffee only 10p each.
