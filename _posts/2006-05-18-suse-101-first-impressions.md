At last I managed to install SuSE 10.1 on my tablet pc/convertible (Toshiba Portege m200).

The new things I like:  
* NetworkManager  
* Cursor Theme  
* Better performance (can&#8217;t be 100% sure)  
* The separation of non-oss form oss software

Things that confuse me, that I don&#8217;t like or from that I am disappointed:  
* Gnome 2.12 and not 2.14 is included  
* NVidia commercial driver is neither on the Add-on CD nor in the Online Update &#8211; I support the fully oss distribution, but not quite understand why is it missing on the add-on cd with the closed source software.  
* The clock (&#8220;thinking&#8221; or whatever) cursor flickers with the NVidia closed source driver  
* The right click menu in Nautilus for a folder is full of &#8220;Open with&#8221; &#8211; not a single menuitem with a submenu but rather many menuitems. It makes the menu to overcrowded.  
* The XGL/Compiz configuration GUI in the gnome control panel did absolutly nothing, so I configured it by hand
