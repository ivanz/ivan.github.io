  * Woke up only to see that all the clocks have moved an hour forward (DST off). Sleep&#8211;.
  * Very nice sunny weather today. Only warm when it&#8217;s sunny though :).
  * BBQ with Z, Stuart and Roy in the back-garden. It&#8217;s the first time I see a disposable BBQ and I must say I like much more the proper BBQ we have back home in our summer house. I must admit after some trouble to light it up I kind of gave up on it and ended up cooking Z&#8217;s and mine food on the inside grill. Roy and Tooey were quite persistent and managed to grill their food so well done for them (the grill was too tiny for four people anyway). It was nice doing something different especially when it&#8217;s so sunny outside! <div id="attachment_437" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

      * Watched [Vantage Point][1] with Z. Despite the semi-interesting way of telling the story the movie was basically all about how the Americans are invincible, especially their president and they always win at the end of the day. Not much content in this movie.
