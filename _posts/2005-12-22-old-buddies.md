Today I went for a Christmas party in my old school. I was very happy, because I managed to see some of my old friends and talk about how is it going and stuff. I also saw some of the teachers, who were very happy to have a chat with me about how is it going in the UK. People haven&#8217;t chanched much since I last saw them &#8211; me too I hope ;). The only thing two-three friends told me is that I&#8217;ve started now and then to speak too quick in Bulgarian. Dunno why, probably, cause I haven&#8217;t spoken in Bulgarian for ages.
