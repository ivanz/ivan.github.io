Years ago when I came to the UK to do my BSc degree and Bulgaria was not yet a member of the EU it was a major pain to open a UK bank account. I talked to staff from Barclays, HSBC and NatWest. From all those 3 major banks only NatWest had reasonable conditions all the others had crazy stuff like depositing a **lot **of money and not being able to use them for 2 years or so. Today that&#8217;s no longer the case.

I&#8217;ve had good customer experience and they&#8217;ve always been polite and done what I&#8217;ve requested without wasting my time. E.g changing all my addresses (including Credit Card&#8217;s) they did in 5 minutes.

1. Bad things started happen about an year, year and a half ago about the time when Firefox 3.0 was released. Their ugly online banking system even today doesn&#8217;t support Firefox 3.0+. So my only choice was to use Opera on Linux.

2. One of my debit cards expired last month and I didn&#8217;t get a replacement at all. I had to waste time contacting the bank only to be told that if I haven&#8217;t received the card then it&#8217;s was sent to my old address (changed about one year ago) and that if I have changed my address in the last year they always send the new cards to the old address. WTF?

3. Last  years I switched to online statements. All good and green alright. However this month I badly needed official printed statements with my name and address on them as a proof of funds for post-study work permit. I went personally to the bank and requested they send me the printed statements. They said &#8220;*No problem it will take 10 work days max, but usually only takes 2-3 days.*&#8220;. 15 work days later with the statements not yet arrived I went again to my branch and asked what&#8217;s going on. &#8220;*Sir, there is no record that you have requested the statements.*&#8221; WHAT? And apparently it turns out there isn&#8217;t a single document they can provide me with that has my name and address on it. E.g. they can print my transaction history but it doesn&#8217;t have those details so it can&#8217;t be used as an official document. I needed those statements for next week god damn it. Requested them again and surprise surprise after 15 days I still haven&#8217;t received my statements and even if I do it&#8217;s already too late.

Screw you NatWest! I am switching banks the moment I get some free time&#8230;
