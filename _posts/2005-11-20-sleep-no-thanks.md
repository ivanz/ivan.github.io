Another sleepless night, so I decided to check sup with my bloggy ;). Exams are coming for me, but you know I am always up for some coding. In the uni we are going to start a development project for linux tablet pc software. We are going to use Mono and GTK#, so basically it won&#8217;t be only for Linux, but I personally am targeting at linux. It is a pitty, because I find GTK+ to look bad. Anyway we will see what will happen with the project, since we are are going to have exams and Christmas is coming too. At the moment I am waiting for the project to be accepted on berlios.de (I&#8217;ve chosen it and not sourceforge.net, because of the SVN repository). That&#8217;s all. Bye!
