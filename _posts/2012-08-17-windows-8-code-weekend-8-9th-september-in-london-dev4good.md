We’re running a second dev4good event in collaboration with TheGivingLab.org and Givey this year to bring together talented thinkers, designers and coders from around the UK to work on some real-world issues faced by UK charities. The technology theme for the event is **Windows 8**, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no prior knowledge</strong></span> of Windows 8 app development is required.

Microsoft will present *Windows 8 Developer Overview*, showing us the technical perspective. Seren will be next up talking about how to design a great experience on Windows 8. (Full details of these sessions will follow shortly.) TheGivingLab.org, will be sharing charity projects, apps and experiences they’d like inspire you with and sharing learnings from their first tech experiment www.seethedifference.org. We may even work on one of your own ideas – if you’ve got one.

Our goals for the weekend are simple. We want to learn how to create Windows 8 apps that could change the way people live their lives – and then we’re going to spend the rest of the time doing it!

  <p>
    If you are a software developer (on any platform), designer, computing student, or are just interested in help out – then we need you. It’s going to be a real challenge – and sleep will be optional. Are you up for it? If you are, the event page is <a href="http://www.dev4good.net/windows-8-code-weekend-2012">here</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Remember, this is a not-for-profit event being run by volunteers, so you won’t be paid for the work you do. You will, however, get to meet and work with some of the smartest developers and designers in the UK – all while doing some real good for society.
  </p>

    We’re also looking for sponsorship for this event, so please <a href="http://dev4good.net/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a> if you believe you can help in any way.
