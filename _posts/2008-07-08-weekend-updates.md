  * Watched the *Norwich Lord Mayor&#8217;s Procession* sitting comfortably in my chair behind my huge window. Was great fun and OMG there were guys dressed like Star Wars characters in the Procession (Norfolk&#8217;s Star Wars club or something).
  * The Linux UVC Video Class Driver managed to get squeezed in in kernel 2.6.26-rc9. It was supposed to be added to the kernel in 2.6.27 (<a href="{{ site.url }}/2008/07/01/support-for-100plus-webcams-in-linux-2627-usb-video-class-driver/" target="_blank">as my previous blog post on the matter informed</a>), but I guess because the driver is self-contained it won&#8217;t cause regressions. Alos it&#8217;s fairly well tested already.
  * I have updated pidgin-otr and libotr for openSUSE to version 3.2.0 in the [GNOME:Community][1] repository. pidgin-otr is an [Off-the-Record Messaging][2] plugin for Pidgin.
  * I have fixed a &#8220;bug&#8221; in my [Disqus WordPress Widget][3] that caused TinyMCE editor to fail to load. The bug was super-awesome &#8211; some weird unicode char at the end of the .php. (wtf?)
  * Jumped up-up and down like a mad man at a Drum&#8217; n&#8217; Bass party in Norwich. Seems like the people that listen to non-Rock/Punk/etc music in England are a minority. I don&#8217;t count &#8220;House&#8221; as music. Also I guesss I should mention that my style of preference is the classic Goa Trance sound and some more organic sounding Psychedelic Trance.
  * Tasted *Tequila Rose Strawberry Liqueur*, which was quite sweet for my taste and didn&#8217;t give me the thrills of drinking the plain ol&#8217; tequila.

  * Got rid off my crappy blue-greenish WordPress theme and replaced with this new cool and simple one. It&#8217;s called [blog.txt][4].
