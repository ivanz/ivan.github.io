### Cinema

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-178" title="forbidden-kingdom" src="http://ivanz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/forbidden-kingdom.jpg" alt="" width="123" height="188" />][1]**The Forbidden Kingdom**

> A discovery made by a kung fu obsessed American teen sends him on an adventure to China, where he joins up with a band of martial arts warriors in order to free the imprisoned Monkey King.

Disappointing. Very childish and completely lacking a culmination. There is one average fighting scene between Jackie Chan and Jet Li and that&#8217;s about it. A very bad try to Americanize.

My Rating: 2.5 out of 5

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-181" title="kung-fu-panda" src="http://ivanz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/kung-fu-panda.jpg" alt="" width="117" height="187" />][2]**Kung Fu Panda**

> Po the Panda is the laziest animals in all of the Valley of Peace, but unwittingly becomes the chosen one when enemies threaten their way of life.

Unfortunately all of the funny moments were in the trailer, so it ended up being a bit of \`a disappointment seeing the movie, probably due to my high expectation. After all this is supposed to be a kiddies movie so I&#8217;ll give it&#8230;

My Rating: 3 out of 5

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-179" style="float: left;" title="hancock" src="http://ivanz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/hancock.jpg" alt="" width="133" height="203" />][3]**Hancock**

> A hard-living superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public enters into a questionable relationship with the wife of the public relations professional who&#8217;s trying to repair his image.

Enjoyed. The movie came as a surprise as I was expecting yet another comic book super hero movie, but it&#8217;s not this at all. I guess many people were disappointed, but for me it was a breath of fresh air. I can&#8217;t tell you more without spoiling the movie for you, sorry.

My Rating: 4.5 out of 5

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-180" title="indiana-jones" src="http://ivanz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/indiana-jones.jpg" alt="" width="147" height="220" />][4]**Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull**

> Famed archaeologist/adventurer Dr. Henry &#8220;Indiana&#8221; Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls.

Waaaaay too cheesy compared to the originals. Also &#8230; come on &#8230; they&#8217;ve managed to squeeze in both a nuclear bomb explosion and a flying saucer as unrelated events. Mr. Jones is and looks too old already. The whole idea of pushing an &#8220;young Indiana Jones&#8221; throughout the movies was ridiculous.

My Rating: 2.5 out of 5

### DVD

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-182" title="sin-city" src="http://ivanz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sin-city.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="156" />][5]**Sin City**

> A film that explores the dark and miserable town Basin City and tells the story of three different people, all caught up in the violent corruption of the city.

Despite being artsy, gross and with a few good catch phrases this movie was completely pointless.

My Rating: 1.5 out of 5

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-183" title="sky-high" src="http://ivanz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/sky-high.jpg" alt="" width="123" height="174" />][6]**Sky High**

> Set in a world where superheroes are commonly known and accepted, young Will Stronghold, the son of the Commander and Jetstream, tries to find a balance between being a normal teenager and an extraordinary being.

Very simple, easy to watch and enjoyable movie.

My Rating: 4 out of 5

[<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-184" title="zodiac" src="http://ivanz.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/zodiac.jpg" alt="" width="103" height="169" />][7]**Zodiac**

> Based on the Robert Graysmith books about the real life notorious Zodiac, a serial killer who terrorized San Francisco with a string of seemingly random murders during the 1960s and 1970s.

I really wasn&#8217;t prepared for a 3 hours long documentary-style movie where nothing really happens <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at all</span>.
