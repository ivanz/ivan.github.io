Two quick updates:

The mspec parallel test runner for TeamCity nuget package is now located at: <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Machine.Specifications.TeamCityParallelRunner/" target="_blank">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Machine.Specifications.TeamCityParallelRunner/</a>

This change was required in order to start following the MSpec version numbers and package naming convention.

The package version as of this moment is 0.9.0, which matches MSpec 0.9.0.

If you know how to write a .nuspec which can tell NuGet that it should obsolete one package with another packages &#8211; do let me know, please.
