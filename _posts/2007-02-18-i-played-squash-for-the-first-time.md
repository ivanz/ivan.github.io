I played squash for the first time and it was really really really tiring. Even though smacking a rubber ball against the wall in a small dark room seems like something a young depressed businessmen would do, it is actually fun! :-). Also it was a bit confusing, because of the slightly different shape of the rocket (compared to tennis), which broke my user model and caused me a bit of trouble, but eventually I got used to it. Fun fun fun&#8230;

And of course a shot:
