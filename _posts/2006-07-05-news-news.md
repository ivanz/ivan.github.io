It has been a month since I&#8217;ve last written anything, but here we go&#8230;

The blog is updated, the theme is changed, there is a new gallery and new pics inside.

I&#8217;ve decided to spend my whole summer on Mono development and more concrette on a the .Net 2.0 built-in designer host implementation (DesignSurface, DesignSurfaceManager). I am progressing really slow due to the lack of documentation. I am using an example provided by M$ for DesignSurface, where I am replacing part by part the design-time stuff with future Mono code. I will make the code available in my subversion repository as soon as I have something that is good enough to show :).
