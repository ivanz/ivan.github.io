It turns out that 5 years ago or even more, when my English wasn&#8217;t very good (not that it is now) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I&#8217;ve stumbled upon the English verb &#8220;<em>to shrug</em>&#8221; and I&#8217;ve assumed that it means &#8220;<em>to scratch (my head)</em>&#8220;.</span> Since then I&#8217;ve used &#8220;*/me shrugs*&#8221; probably a gazillion times during technical discussion on IRC. I was merely intending to mean &#8220;*/me is scratching (head, thinking hard on what was said)*&#8220;.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Please accept my personal apology if I made you feel ignored or disrespected in any way! It wasn&#8217;t my intention!</strong></span>
