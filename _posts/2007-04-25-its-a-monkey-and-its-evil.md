Hey all! My name is Ivan and I&#8217;ll be working on the Design Time stuffs in the class library to bring up a Windows Forms Designer for GSoC. In other words &#8230; all your base are belong to me! Btw the dots in the name for the GSoC project are typos.

Not that anyone cares, but I am 20 years old, in the second year of my BSc Software Engineering degree in the University of Hull. I am a lover of C# and Mono and a lover of openSUSE. I like strange music, strange movies and strange people. That below is a photo of me and not a photo of the back of a sign in Italy!
