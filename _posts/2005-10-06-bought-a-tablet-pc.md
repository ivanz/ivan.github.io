At last I received my Tablet PC &#8211; Toshiba Portege M200 1,7 GHZ Centrino, 512 DDR RAM, 60GB, IRDA, BLUETOOTH. It is just so nice. I needed to pay 93 pounds VAT, althought I don&#8217;t think I really need to. Already installed all Reverse Code Engineering and Software Development Tools. There is only one thing that I don&#8217;t like &#8211; the display is a little sluggy, because of the coverage for the pen.<a target="_blank" title="m200 award" href="{{ site.url }}/blog/wp-content/photos/m200_award.jpg"><br /> </a>
