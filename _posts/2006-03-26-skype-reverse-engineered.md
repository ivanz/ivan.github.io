I had this presentation for a while already, but forgot to put it online on my blog. I was quite impressed that skype had custom binary protections, which of course are not very impressive from what I&#8217;ve read. Anyway here is the link &#8211; <a href=http://ivanz.com/files/blog/reverse%20engineering%20skype%20-%20bh-eu-06-biondi-up.pdf>Skype Reverse Engineered</a>. I don&#8217;t know if we should hope for an open implementation one day&#8230;
