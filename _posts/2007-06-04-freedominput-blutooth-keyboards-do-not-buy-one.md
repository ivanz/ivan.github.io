**DO NOT BUY ONE!!!!!!!**

I was waiting for my plane at the Manchester airport yesterday and I had to waste 2 hours. I decided to get a bluetooth keyboard for my Nokia N800, so at least I can do some productive work. Fortunately there was a Dixons shop in the free duty area and I headed directly in and grabbed a what at the time seemed to be a very decent piece of BT keyboard with HID and SPP compatible with all major devices. Well the n800 wasn&#8217;t listed but it&#8217;s a HID bt device, so it should have worked out of the box.

I opened the box and read the quick setup guide and I was quite surprised to read extremely important information which **is not mentioned on the packaging**&#8230; ***One can only ever use the keyboard with 2 devices*, because *the keyboard is locked* and *requires a special driver*. Each piece of hardware you want to use it on *has to be registered***** on the web site via 2 unique codes, supplied in the box, so you end up with 2 unique unlock keys specific for the 2 pieces of hardware. What a fraud, lock-up and scam! **

I went back and returned the keyboard and got full money refund from Dixons. It&#8217;s such a sad world we live in.
