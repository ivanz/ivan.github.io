  * Thoroughly cleaned my room and the large bathroom in the house.
  * Was supposed to do lots of work on my Security Assessment coursework, but didn&#8217;t do any because I was avoiding doing the cleaning all day instead :). Also I hit a very annoying OpenOffice bug where the second level of a numbered bullet list &#8220;1.1&#8221; will indent the text in some stupid way. Filed it as bug [#489994][1].

  * Fixed a few more DataGridView bugs for cell resizing when there are no column headers and also some cell border drawing stuff.
  * Added my Amazon Wish List to my [FriendFeed account][2].
