Imagine the perfect journey&#8230; Now picture the following&#8230;

5 hours sleep for 2 days (48h). Waking up 7:45am after going in bed at about 2am, but having trouble falling asleep till 4am. Go out to catch the bus to the train station. At the last minute girlfriend finds out she has forgotten her mobile phone (can happen to everyone of course). Run back home to get it. Miss bus. Miss train. Catch later train. Reach first station for changing to another train. Be told that the other train doesn&#8217;t go to the airport due to engineering works on the tracks. Take bus. Go to airport. Send girlfriend back home. Go back to train-station to catch train back to home. Train gets canceled due to someone from the crew not coming (to work?). Wait for the next train. Too many people &#8211; not enough space. Miss change and wait for the next train. Get on train. Have a drunken guy sitting right next to you with his girlfriend in him, explaining how much he loves her during the whole journey. Train catches fire (apparently somewhere in the back and I haven&#8217;t smelled nor witnessed anything). Transport police. Got back home at about 9pp. Journey duration in one direction is supposed to be approximately 2h and 30min. So that&#8217;s 5 pure train travel, about an hour waiting for train changes, about 20minutes on the airport and two times 20mins with a taxi/bus to and from the train-station&#8230; equals approx 7h. I ended up with 14h journey&#8230; MOAN! Good night!

P.S: For the past 2 weeks I had my girlfriend staying with me in the UK. We had great time together. We went down London (from Hull) for a couple of days and went sight seeing, also we stayed in York for a day. York is an incredibly nice place for a day-walk&#8230; not to mention the bag of hand-made chocolate we returned with <img src="{{ site.url }}/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (sadly couldn&#8217;t find any hand-made ice-cream). I so miss her already. Anyway I am in a bit of a trouble now, because the deadline for my Software Engineering coursework is approaching. It&#8217;s huge :-(. I have to apply the Microsoft Solution Architecture Framework to an use case and just the plain requirements for the deliverables are 4 pages&#8230;
