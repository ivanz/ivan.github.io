I recently updated from openSUSE 11.0 to 11.1 (installed fresh) and I am very disappointed.

Out of the box broken are:

  * DVD burning
  * GNOME session saving
  * wvdial, so I can&#8217;t use my phone as a 3G/data modem.
  * [Dropbox][1], which seems to be working fine in every other distribution released recently. Also was working fine in 11.0.
  * VirtualBox USB
  * Skype (yes, I do use it every now and than to talk to my friends/parents)

Other new annoyances in 11.1:

  * When restarting X there is an insanely loud and painful for the ears 1-2 second beep/buzz.
  * There is the same beep/buzz in tty when you perform various actions

Pretty bad for me. I have nothing more to say, ciao.

P.S: I am aware that there are workarounds for most of those issues.
