  * Finally woke up once on time (9:30am). Left Z to doze while I sorted out my mail and read my feeds in google reader.
  * Cycled 18km, 52min, 410kcal, heart rate ~122bpm. Up one difficulty level (5/8)
  * [MonoDevelop 2.0 was released today][1]. It&#8217;s probably the best modern IDE at the moment available on Linux. I can only hope that Mono and MonoDevelop pick up more for Linux applications and frameworks development. The critical mass adoption will play crucial role.
  * Although I love OpenOffice and its flexibility (which has some learning curve there) I must admit I got really pissed off today after spending ages trying to figure out how to split my bibliographic entry on new lines (e.g have Author and Title on two separate lines) to no go. I have to use the Harvard Style which requires new lines so I will have to write my own table and references by hand and only hope that I won&#8217;t have to reorder the references.
  * Went to the gym. Seems I have increased some of my muscles capacity by 5kg. Nice.
