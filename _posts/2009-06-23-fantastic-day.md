Today was an amazing sunny day without even a single cloud in the sky. After so many depressing gray and rainy days I absolutely enjoyed drinking my coffee outside and then having a walk in the quite nice [Pearson Park][1] (in Hull).

I really wanted to take some photos so I grabbed my camera before going to the park. Unfortunately it just doesn&#8217;t work walking around thinking &#8220;I wanna take a shot of something, I wanna take a shot of something&#8221;. Inspiration and spontaneity are required. I took a couple of photos but those two were lacking so I just gave up and enjoyed just walking around.

Here is the only one that I liked. It&#8217;s nothing special but I like the dark green.
