I came up with the conclusion that I would be much more comfortable with having the formatting options in Tomboy in the toolbar. Of course polluting the toolbar with loads of formatting options is not a good idea either. I came up with the idea to have the very basic formatting options in the main toolbar and then at the end of it have a +/- to expand/hide a second toolbar with additional formatting options. Check out the mock-up below and drop your comments at <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433616" target="_blank">#433616</a> . Feel free to shoot out my idea. <img src="http://ivanz.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
