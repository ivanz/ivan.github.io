A few minutes ago the new FireFox was released. No major GUI changes to notice, except the rearrangement of the Preferences dialog, the ability to edit the toolbar and to rearrange the tabs. Page rendering is faster ( because of the new gecko engine ) and at last there is an option to disable opening of new windows and force tabs only &#8211; a long waited option by me. As for the new technologies &#8211; CSS2, CSS3 and JavaScript 1.6.
