**EDIT:** As I expected the tabs thing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>is a prank</strong></span>! Take a deep breath everyone and relax.

I really hope this GNOME 3.0 Tabs &#8220;mania&#8221; is a prank, because it just seems so, sooooo stupid. Really. It&#8217;s like flushing down the toilet all of the UI simplicity that GNOME is supposedly aiming for.

Here is a mock-up screenshot of how GNOME 3 Release Name &#8220;Tabs&#8221; could look like if this insanity becomes reality. (Click &#8220;*Full Size*&#8221; bottom-left in the popup for a good resolution)

<p style="text-align: center;">

  * Why the hell would I want to have Tabs in my movie player? Am I going to watch two things at the same time?
  * Why the hell would I want to click on Tabs like insane in my instant messenger where there is already perfect treeview based organization and protocol icon-based indication? I will be happy to have a search box, but tabs? &#8211; No, thanks.
  * Also why would I want to have Tabs in my audio player when there is already a treeview with different Views to select (Playlists and others)?

So, yeah, in case this isn&#8217;t a prank&#8230; please don&#8217;t do this to us!
