A huge part of the equalization work is in [CVS][1] now. Seems like [Aaron Bockover][2] really [dove into it][3] after I&#8217;ve sent my patch to the list. He also made a redesign of the equalizer dialog and it looks extremly nice and clean.

P.S: I&#8217;ve updated my [Xine Engine][4] to match the fixed frequencies behaviour in Banshee.
