Today I posted my first Mono bug <img src="{{ site.url }}/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=76907. I tought I am doing something wrong, but at the end I posted it to the mailing list and got a mail to file a bug. A guy asked me to assign the bug to him, so I won&#8217;t try to fix it myself (or may be I will try ðŸ˜‰ ). iNotesMaker.GUI.Note is frozen till this bug is fixed and new version of Mono is released.
