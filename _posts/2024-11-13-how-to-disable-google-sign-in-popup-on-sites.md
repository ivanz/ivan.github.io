I recently got a bit tired of all those pop-ups everywhere asking me to sign in with Google. Especially the bad/overly aggressive implementations, where they do that in every single new tab you open of the same site/app (I am looking at you TripAdvisorðŸ˜‘). Thankfully it's possible to turn it off.

## Steps for Web

1. Install your favourite ad blocker (e.g. I use [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)) Add the following custom rule and you are done

`||accounts.google.com/gsi/*`

## Steps for Android apps
1. **Go to `My Account` -> `Security` ([link](https://myaccount.google.com/security))**
2. **Scroll down to `Your connections to third-party apps and services` and click on `See all connections`**

3. **Click on the gear/cog icon:**
