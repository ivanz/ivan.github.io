For a long time the default and very painful behaviour between the integration of iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) and Gmail&#8217;s Exchange support (required for push email) has been that whenever you delete an email it will actually archive it instead (put it in the &#8220;All Mail&#8221; folder).

Like me many people hated that and have been complaining for a long time on Google&#8217;s Forum, Groups and Feedback sites. I have personally been using a &#8220;delete&#8221; label and moving messages there to delete later on my PC.

No more!

Apparently Google have quietly (I have not seen an announcement?) added a feature to disable this annoying behavior and deleted mail will end up in Gmail&#8217;s Trash folder instead.

To enable it you have to open the Google Sync settings page from your mobile device at <http://m.google.com/sync> . Note that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you can not access this page from your computer</span>.

In there you will see a new checkbox saying something like &#8220;Move delete mail to Trash&#8221;. Tick, save, boom.

P.S: BTW for those of you who don&#8217;t know this is also the place where you pick which Google Calendar Calendars to make available for syncing on your device.
