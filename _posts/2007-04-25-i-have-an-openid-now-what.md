<a href="http://janrain.com/openid" target="_blank">OpenID</a> &#8211; an open single sign-on system. Great! One user-name/pass for all sites requiring a login. I used <a href="http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID/" target="_blank">phpMyID</a>, so I can use my domain&#8217;s url, but one can easily get an OpenID at <a href="https://www.myopenid.com" target="_blank">https://www.myopenid.com</a>. It have been about two months since I&#8217;ve got my OpenID, but yet I haven&#8217;t had the change to use it for once. While there are popular sites like <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a> and <a href="http://openiddirectory.com/" target="_blank">more</a> that support it, I haven&#8217;t had the luck to stumble upon a web site, which supports it and is of use to me.

Imagine if Bugzilla supported OpenID (there have been some efforts 2 years ago &#8211; <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294608" target="_blank">#</a><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=294608" target="_blank">294608</a>)? There are so many open source projects that use Bugzilla for bug tracking and yet a user wanting to report a bug will have to register on each of those. I bet two from three users just can&#8217;t be bothered to register for the sake of reporting a single bug with the thought &#8220;Surely someone else will report it very soon&#8221;. Developers lose and users lose. What about OpenID authenticated pick-your-version-control-system-name commits? There seem to be plugins to enable OpenID in Trac, MediaWiki and others, so why don&#8217;t people install those? Come one people, let&#8217;s embrace the technology and make our life easier! The more people that have OpenIDs the more demand on the web sites to embrace it. Also there is a large number of people that probably don&#8217;t have a clue what OpenID is, but have one for example AOL/AIM users, Yahoo! users, etc. I am waiting for the day when I will be able to login in let&#8217;s say Amazon with my OpenID&#8230;
