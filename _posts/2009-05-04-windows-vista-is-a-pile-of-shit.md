Before I begin with my rant I want to make it very clear that I am not an anti-Microsoft junkie and that I have been a happy user of Windows for a long time both in Virtual Machines and on real hardware.

I wasted most of my day with Windows Vista SP1 yesterday and ended up wiping it out and installing XP. I spent ages updating a fresh Vista install (had to reboot about 15 times after each windows update), installing and updating Visual Studio 2008 Team System and SQL Server 2008 Enterprise. Here is my rant:

  * Vista was never designed for multi-tasking. 
      * It&#8217;s dog slow even on my 3GB Ram, Intel C2D machine.
      * Doing more than 2 things at a time basically brings the system down to its knees.
      * Installing Windows Updates or performing any other intensive task resulted jittery sound while listening to music.
      * &#8220;Not Responding&#8221; is standard behavior one has to get used to.
  * SQL Server 2008 SP1 + Visual Studio SP1 simply doesn&#8217;t work out of the box on Vista, but does on XP. All sorts of weird errors, named pipe problems and so on.
  * Copying very large files (1GB+) from a shared folder results Explorer hang (&#8220;Not Responding&#8221;)
  * and more and more and more&#8230;

Basically trying to do anything productive as a developer on Vista is shit. Back to XP.
