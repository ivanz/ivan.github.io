Today I had 2 lectures and 1 workshop. The first lecture was Programming 1 and we are getting deeper into searching algorithms and the other lecture was in IT and Proffesional Skills. The workshop was in Quantitive Methods for Computing &#8211; we exersiced Logical Maths (or, and, not, etc). There were pretty nice problems to solve. I should do more problem solving in this topic this weekend. Basically was not so boring day <img src="http://ivanz.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
