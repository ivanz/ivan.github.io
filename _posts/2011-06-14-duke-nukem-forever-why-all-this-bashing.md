Just finished Duke Nukem Forever on my PS3 and I simply don’t get all this bashing and negative gaming site reviews. The game was very enjoyable and even though there were a few neat mini-puzzles here and there it wasn’t brain challenging at all. But why should it be, anyway? And why should I care about the graphics if I have fun playing it?
