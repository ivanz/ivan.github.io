Yesterday I made the switch to GNOME after using KDE since version 3.0. KDE is really a good desktop environment for Linux, but I find GNOME simplier and faster. If I compare the amount of used RAM now it is 5 times less than if I use KDE. Also I know C and a little bit of GTK+ and will be able to contribute this and that to GNOME and the programs I use (eg bugfixes and small patches) compared to KDE where I have no idea of C++ and QT. Also I don&#8217;t really like that QT has this dual licensing. Also I am targeting on development based on MONO and GTK#, so GNOME is the proper desktop environment for me. I really like GNOME much more than KDE for the 2 days I&#8217;ve been using it.
